Binary search
    - splits answers into a binary e.g higher lower

within lists:
lista = []

retrun will break wile loops, good for doing loops where you want an input to cause the break

'''1. Determine what you need for the algorithm'''
2. Determine how to express a certain step
3. See step 2.
4. Run algorithm
5. If not working, see step 6. otherwise, finish
6. diagnose the problem
7. see step 2 if neccesary.

range(10) returns a range object.
range(9999999999) would be very power intensive as its giving a list of o to x

need to cast list
>>> list(range(10))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

>>> list(range(3, 15, 3))
[3, 6, 9, 12]
