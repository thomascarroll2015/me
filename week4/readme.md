find insight
visualise the data
communicate the insight

for loops are safer than while loops

start stop step

when for i in range

i is the actual object in the list

As a rule of thumb, data with 1000 rows or more is pretty good

open

.write
.close
.load          loads from a file object 
.loads         loads a string from file object

response code of 200 means all is well

mode is string "w" , "r" , "r+"

Keys are strings, before colon
can call upon keys with

../ means go up or back the file chain  

File directory will be a big issue for those who dont understand the directory and how files organise

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
