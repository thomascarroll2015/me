Using describe() on categorical data will produce similar output to a Series or DataFrame of type string.

Categorical data has a categories and a ordered property, which list their possible values and whether the ordering matters or not. These properties are exposed as s.cat.categories and s.cat.ordered. If you donâ€™t manually specify categories and ordering, they are inferred from the passed arguments.
