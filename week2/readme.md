TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week learning about strings and syntax, feeling overwhelmed.


[] house lists i think
Syntax around = + operators need spaces

Definitions create functions to use. e.g

def function_name(parameters):
	"""docstring"""
	statement(s)

def greet(name):
    """ This will print the name parameter with other text """
    print ("hello " + name)

greet("tom")

this would print "hello tom"


append adds to the end of a list, I think you can also append items with a position like GH
