TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week learning about strings and syntax, feeling overwhelmed.


[] house lists i think
Syntax around = + need spaces


append adds to the end of a list, I think you can also append items with a position like 

Use Int() and str() for conversions

python ../course/week2/tests.py

Comparison Operators! Float values can be = int values but neither can be to str values

==      equal to
!=      not equal to
<
>
<=
>=

Boolean operators

and     Compares pre and post for boolean double confirm

or      looks for ans in 2 i.e true and false = true
        need both false for a false return

not     goes to other value 'not true = false'

INDENTATION

indentation causes "blocks" which tell python what to do 

i.e 

this = input()

if input() = jaum:
    print ("hello jaum")
print ('done')

indentation is defining your pragmatic blocks of logic, blocks within blocks

while statements start again from condition after they run 

if statements move down the code after they are read
